# Servo Motor Control

This Arduino script demonstrates how to control the position of a servo motor using the Servo library.

## Description

The script moves a servo motor (Servo1) to various positions in steps of 30 degrees, with a delay of 500 milliseconds between each movement. It starts from -180 degrees, moves to 180 degrees, and then returns to -180 degrees.

## Instructions

1. Connect the servo motor to digital pin 9 of the Arduino board.
2. Upload the script to the Arduino board.
3. Observe the movement of the servo motor as it changes positions.

## Components Required

- Arduino board
- Servo motor
- Jumper wires

## Installation

1. Connect the servo motor to the Arduino board.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Include the Servo library (`#include <Servo.h>`).
4. Upload the script to the Arduino board.
